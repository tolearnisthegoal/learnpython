Vriables are containers, that contain stuff, just like in kitchen we have salt in a salt container, Sugar in sugar cotainer etc.
And you can change content as you wish.
Creating a variable is like creating a place holder and assigning it value in the memory.

integer         a = 1
boolean         b = true
string          c = "Name"
None type       d = none
