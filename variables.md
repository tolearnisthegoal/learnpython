Vriables are containers, that contain stuff, just like in kitchen we have salt in a salt container, Sugar in sugar cotainer etc.
And you can change content as you wish.
Creating a variable is like creating a place holder and assigning it value in the memory.

integer         a = 1
boolean         b = true
string          c = "Name"
None type       d = none


<!-- type of variable -->
type( variable name )  tells the type of variable.


 <!-- Built-in data types -->
<!-- Numeric Data -->
int     = 0, -8, 6
float   = 0.32, 33.33
complex = 6 + 2i

<!-- string variables -->
string = "name" or anything text in double or single quotation marks.

<!-- Boolean data types -->
true and false

list, tuple and dictionary are also data types but are for the later lessons. right now you should only know they are data types.


In Python everything is an object just for your information, remember this, everything is an object = variables, tuples, lists etc...
