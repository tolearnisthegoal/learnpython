We want to see each thing, like a letter, number, or item, one by one.

Just to observe or show it.'''

Imagine you have an empty piggy bank üêñ.

Each letter is a coin ü™ô.

You put one coin in the piggy bank each time.

collected = collected + letter means:

Take what you already have, and add the new letter to it.

You cannot say letter + collected = ... because Python only lets you assign to the left side of = (like saying ‚Äúbox = old coins + new coin‚Äù).

i is the step number.

word[i] is the letter at that number.

Why range(len(word))?
range(2) means: 0, 1.

len(word) = how many steps you take.

range(len(...)) is like: ‚ÄúGive me all step numbers for the word.‚Äù
