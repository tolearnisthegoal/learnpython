User Input in python is taken by: input() function.
We can take it directly using input() function from user as string/Character, 

<!-- One of the basic program for taking input -->
a = input()
print(a)

<!-- You can aslo do this: -->
a = input("Enter you name: ")
print(a)

input() function only take value in as a string, so if we want to use another data-type, we have to typecast it.

<!-- This is not going to work as a calculator-->
a = input("enter any number)
b = input("enter any number)
print = (a+b)
what it doing in concatenating string together
Remeber input() only return data to us developers from users, in string data type we have to change it using type-casting.
